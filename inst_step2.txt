You passed the step 1!

Etapa 2: Aritmetic
------------------

- Connect to server atclab.esi.uclm.es:1987
- You will receive a text string with a mathematical operation in ASCII format.
- The expression contains parentheses and brackets, and are well balanced (there
  are so many opening and closure).
- Calculate the result of the operation and reply through the same socket, placing
  the result within parentheses.
- The process is repeated for an undetermined number of operations.

If everything is right, the server will instruct you to continue.
You have 20 seconds.

Tracks:
- The parentheses are vital, the spaces trivial.
- The symbol '/' represents an entire division.
- Example:
   - server: (2 * [3+ 5] * {1 -0})
   - client: (16)

Restrictions:
- It is not allowed to use the function eval(), exec() or any other that evaluates
  python statements.

You have 20 seconds.
