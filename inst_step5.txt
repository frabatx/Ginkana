Step 5: Proxy Web
------------------

- Create an HTTP Proxy server on your computer (in the port of your choice).
- Your server will receive a random amount of HTTP requests for download
  third-party URLs, you must download these resources (using HTTP) and
  return them to the requesting customer.

 +--------+        +--------------+       +-------------+
 | Client |        | Proxy server |       | HTTP server |
 +--------+        +--------------+       +-------------+
      |                    |                     |
      |  GET(server, url)  |                     |
      +------------------>+++  connect(server)   |
      |                   | |------------------->|
      |                   | |   file: GET(url)   |
      |      file         | |------------------->|
      |<------------------+++                    |
      |                    |                     |


- Create a client socket and send a message to the server TCP atclab.esi.uclm.es:9000
  Indicating the identifier "42744" and the port on which you have created
  Your proxy server, separated by a space.
  Example: "42744 7777".
- Through the same socket you will receive further instructions or information
  about errors.

Hints:
- Caution: Your proxy will receive simultaneous requests and it is expected that
  serve them quickly. If it takes too long, this step will fail. In order to
  achieve it create a concurrent server for your proxy.
- You can prove that your proxy is right by executing it as a independent program
  (unrelated to ginkana) and configuring your browser to use it.

Restrictions:
- It is not allowed to use the classes HTTPServer,
  SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler and the http.server module.

You have 5 seconds.
